<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Install a released h0x-cli CLI (Node SEA) from GitHub Releases on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
  Windows counterpart of scripts/install.sh. Downloads the release zip, verifies
  its SHA256 checksum, extracts the CLI plus support assets (grammars/, vendor/,
  node_modules/, starter-skills/, assets/) into an install directory, and adds
  that directory to the user PATH.
