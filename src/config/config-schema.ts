// retry/backoff configurable. Older files transparently inherit the defaults,
// and `timeoutMs` keeps its historical 30_000 value, so the migration does not
// change behaviour for anyone who does not opt in.
// v40: new `tui.mouse` flag gating the mouse layer. Defaults to true, so an
// older file inherits mouse support on upgrade; `--no-mouse` and `/mouse off`
// override it without rewriting the file.
// v41: `localModels.managed.autoUpdate` is wired to managed start
// (TUI auto-start / CLI `models start`) and defaults to `true`. Pre-v41
// files stored an unused `false` default — those migrate to `true` so
// existing installs pick up newer llama.cpp zips. Explicit `false` on
// a v41+ file is honoured.
// v43: new `tui.onboarding` block — four nullable ISO timestamps recording
// that the first-run flow was seen, skipped, completed, and that the
// "configure the other backend too" screen was already offered. Additive:
// an older file parses with all four `null`, which reads as "never
// onboarded" and opens the flow exactly once, instead of re-deriving the
// answer from a health probe on every launch.
// v42: no schema change. The bump exists to carry the forward-compat
// rules below: a file whose `version` is *newer* than this constant is
// now read instead of rejected, its version is preserved rather than
// stamped down, and unknown top-level keys survive the round trip. See
// `parseUserConfigFile` and `ensureUserConfigFileSync`.
// v44: localModels gains `customModels` — GGUF models the operator pointed
// at on Hugging Face, stored as full catalog entries. Older files inherit
// `[]`, which is exactly the behaviour they had before the key existed.
// v45: a fifth stamp in `tui.onboarding` — `localSetupSeenAt`, written
// when the first run reaches the local model list rather than when a
// model comes out of it. It is what stops the "set up local models too"
// screen being pitched to an operator who already walked through that
// list and walked back out. Additive: a v43 file parses with it `null`,
// which reads as "never opened", the same answer that file has always
// implied. (It was drafted as a second v44, but v44 was already spent on
// `customModels` in the same release — the stamp ships as v45 so the two
// additive changes keep distinct numbers.)

/**
 * Config versions that `parseUserConfigFile` still accepts on input.
 * v5 renamed the `llama` block to `localModels` to remove the Meta
 * "Llama" conflation — the runtime never ran Llama family models
 * specifically. v6 added the optional `vision.*` block; v7 added
 * `localModels.completionMaxTokens` so users can raise the
 * tool-call `n_predict` cap from the file. v8 added the optional
 * `skills.*` block so installed skills can be turned off without
 * removing files from disk. v9 added the optional `telegram.*`
 * block so the Telegram remote-control channel can be enabled and
 * scoped to a single owner. v10 added `telegram.parseMode` so
 * agent replies render as Telegram HTML by default. v11 added
 * `memory.dedup.*` and `memory.eviction.*` for memory-v2 phase 1A
 * (utility-weighted eviction + FTS5 near-match dedup). v12 added
 * `memory.embeddings.*` and `localModels.embeddings.*` for memory-v2
 * phase 1B (hybrid recall via a second managed `llama-server`
 * dedicated to `/embedding`). v13 added `memory.links.*` for memory-v2
 * phase 2 (link graph + link-generator reflection sub-call). v14 added
 * `memory.evolution.*` for memory-v2 phase 3 (neighbor-evolver +
 * EVOLVE grammar branch + B↔C lease). v15 added `memory.lessons.*` and
 * `memory.consolidation.*` for memory-v2 phase 5 (distilled lessons +
 * cold-path consolidator + first stable-prefix bump for `### lessons`).
 * v16 added `memory.voting.*` for memory-v2 phase 7a (ExpeL-style vote
 * curation — UPVOTE/DOWNVOTE sub-call on the reflection slot + decay
 * on the consolidator tick + utility-eviction + lesson recall reranker).
 * v17 added `memory.procedures.*` for memory-v2 phase 7b (MemP-style
 * advisory procedures distilled alongside lessons + second
 * stable-prefix bump for `### procedures`).
 * v18 added three v2.5 memory fabric additions:
 * `memory.reflection.typedNotes.*` (Phase C — typed-NOTE extraction
 * with per-type forbidden lists),
 * `memory.reflection.segmentation.*` (Phase B — sliding-window
 * reflection segmentation), and `memory.retrieve.rewriter.*` (Phase
 * A — heuristic-gated query rewriter for recall). All three default
 * to disabled so v17 → v18 is a transparent migration.
 * v19 added `memory.reflection.anySpeaker` for multi-party / dialog
 * extraction mode (default `false` — production users keep the
 * user-centric prefix, evaluation benchmarks like LoCoMo flip the
 * flag to true so reflection can extract facts about third-party
 * speakers in the USER channel). Flipping the flag invalidates the
 * reflection slot's KV cache once on the next call.
 * v21 enables memory-v2 advanced layers by default
 * (`memory.evolution`, `memory.lessons`, `memory.procedures`,
 * `memory.consolidation`, `memory.voting`, `memory.retrieve.rewriter`).
 * Upgrades from v20 and below force those `enabled` flags to `true`.
 * v22 also enables `memory.links` by default. Hybrid embedding recall
 * (`memory.embeddings` + `localModels.embeddings`) stays off in the
 * config file until the operator enables it from the TUI Models tab
 * (download + start). Upgrades from v21 and below apply the v22
 * switches for the advanced memory layers only.
 * v23 added the optional `mcp.*` block (MCP client). Upgrades from
 * v22 and below get `mcp: { servers: [] }` — no connections are
 * opened until the operator adds entries to the list.
 * v24 added the optional `llm.*` provider registry block. When
 * absent, the runtime synthesizes `local-llama` from `localModels.*`
 * (byte-stable for existing installs).
 * v25→v26 added `localModels.managed.device` (default `"auto"`) so the
 * managed daemon auto-picks the best GPU at start; older files inherit
 * `"auto"` transparently. v27 added `web.search.*` for the native
 * keyless-first `os.web.search` tool and provider selection.
 * v31→v32 added `localModels.managed.contextSize` (default `0` = auto):
 * the managed chat daemon fits `--ctx-size` to the target device's free
 * VRAM at start; a positive value pins the context explicitly. Older
 * files inherit `0` transparently.
 * v32→v33 added the optional `analytics.*` block (anonymous PostHog
 * product analytics — opt-out via `analytics.enabled: false`). Older
 * files inherit `analytics: { enabled: true }` transparently.
 * v40→v41 wired `localModels.managed.autoUpdate` (default `true`):
 * managed start pulls a newer llama.cpp zip from GitHub Releases when
 * one exists. Pre-v41 the field was stored but never read, so a `false`
 * there carried no meaning and is migrated to `true` — including one a
 * user set deliberately, since the two are indistinguishable on disk.
 * An explicit `false` on a v41+ file is honoured.
 * Older files are transparently upgraded by filling missing
 * blocks/fields from `USER_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`. Anything older than v5
 * is not migrated: this is active development, callers delete their
 * `config.json` and start over.

 *   itself afterwards; before v43 nothing was written here, which is why
 *   an escaped setup used to reappear on every single launch.
 * - `proposedSecondBackendAt` — the "you have one, want the other too?"
 *   screen was already offered, so it is never offered twice.
 * - `localSetupSeenAt` — the local model list was reached, whether or
 *   not a model came out of it. Recorded rather than derived because
 *   backing out of that list leaves no trace anywhere else, and it
 *   survives a launch: an interrupted first run is exactly the case
