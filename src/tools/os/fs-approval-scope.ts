 *  - `outside` — anywhere else (system paths, other volumes, or paths
 *    we failed to canonicalise). Conservative bucket: maps to the
 *    `other` category, which asks on every level except 5.
 *
 * Containment is decided on canonical (realpath) forms, so a symlink
 * inside the workspace that points outside is classified by its target,
 * never by where the link lives. This holds for **dangling** symlinks
 * too: if the leaf is a symlink whose target does not exist yet, we
 * classify by the (resolved) link target rather than the parent — a
 * `writeFile` through such a link creates the file at the target, so
 * treating it as a workspace write would be a silent escape. See
 * `canonicalizeMutationTarget`.

 * link's directory and canonicalise **that** — recursively, so a chain
 * of dangling links is followed to where the write actually lands.
