/**
 * Central colour + glyph palette for the Ink-based TUI. Avoids scattering
 * `color="cyan"` literals across components and keeps the visual language
 * consistent with openclaw's theme contract.
 *
 * Colours are Ink colour names (see https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#color)
 * or explicit hex values. Glyphs are single Unicode code points that render
 * consistently on macOS Terminal, iTerm2, Windows Terminal and Alacritty.
 *
 * The exported `theme` is a `Proxy` over a swappable active theme. Consumers
 * keep importing `{ theme }` and reading `theme.colors.X` at render time;
 * `setActiveTheme(...)` swaps the backing object (used at startup after
 * terminal-background autodetection, and at runtime via `/theme <name>`).
 * Because every consumer reads through the proxy on each render, swapping is
 * invisible to them — a re-render picks up the new colours.
 *
 * Palette definitions live in {@link ./theme-palettes.ts}; this module owns
 * the shared glyphs/spinner, the theme registry, and the proxy machinery.
