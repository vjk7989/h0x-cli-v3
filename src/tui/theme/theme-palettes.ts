/**
 * Colour palettes for every registered TUI theme.
 *
 * Six palettes, all designed here rather than transcribed from upstream
 * terminal themes. That is the change this file records: the registry
 * used to carry twelve, eleven of them mapped onto somebody else's
 * sixteen ANSI slots, and a mapping cannot know which of its colours
 * this app is about to paint *on which ground*. It painted a lot of them
 * on the wrong one — see `theme-contrast.test.ts`, which walks every
 * (ink, ground) pair the UI actually draws and now fails the build when
 * one of them is unreadable.
 *
 * ## Three grounds, not one
 *
 * A terminal app has no page of its own: the terminal owns the
 * background and the app draws on it. But this app also paints two
 * grounds of its own, and every colour token belongs to exactly one of
 * the three:
 *
 *   1. **the page** — the terminal's background, given per palette as
 *      {@link CANONICAL_PAGE}. Every `*text*` role is read here:
 *      `user`, `assistant`, `accent`, `error`, `muted`, and so on.
 *   2. **the rail** — the sidebar, the operator menu, the composer's
 *      meta bar, every popup. Its ground is `railBackground` and the
 *      only colours legible on it are the `rail*` ones.
 *   3. **a chip or badge** — a raised control or an accent-tinted pill.
 *      `chipBackground`/`chipForeground` and `badgeBackground`.
 *
 * Mixing them is the bug class this file was rewritten to make
 * impossible. The old palettes drew the rail *inverted* — a near-white
 * ground on a dark theme — and then components dropped page ink onto it:
 * `github-dark` painted `assistant` (`#e6edf3`) on a `#f0f6fc` rail, a
 * contrast ratio of **1.09:1**. White on white. `tokyo-night` did the
 * same at 1.13:1 and `catppuccin-mocha` put `warn` on its rail at
 * 1.12:1.
 *
 * ## The rail is a surface, not an inversion
 *
 * So the rail no longer flips polarity. It is a *different tone of the
 * same family* — one step off the page, dark on a dark theme and light
 * on a light one — and it carries its own ink set (`railForeground`,
 * `railMuted`, `railAccent`, `railSuccess`, `railWarn`, `railError`).
 * Anything drawn on the rail reaches for those. The invariant a palette
 * must satisfy is no longer "the rail is inverted" (which the house
 * palette never was, since its sidebar is a solid indigo panel) but
 * "the rail is distinguishable from the page, and its own ink is
 * readable on it". Both are checked.
 *
 * ## The gate
 *
 * Text pairs must clear 4.5:1 (WCAG AA for body text). Chrome that is
 * looked at rather than read — `border`, `accentSoft` — only has to be
 * *distinguishable* from its ground, so it is held to 1.5:1 and no
 * more: a hairline rule that met AA would be a wall.
 */

/**
 * The terminal background each palette is designed against.
 *
 * The app never paints this — the terminal owns it — so it is not a
 * `TuiColors` token. It still has to be written down somewhere, because
 * "is this ink readable" is a question about a specific ground, and the
 * contrast gate has to be able to ask it. A palette that ships without
 * a row here does not compile.
 *
 * An operator whose terminal is set to some other background gets a
 * result this table cannot predict; that is what `--theme` and the
 * OSC 11 autodetect in `detect-terminal-background.ts` are for.
