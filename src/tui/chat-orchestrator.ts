   * With a turn in flight this is a DETACH, not an abort: the
   * concurrency contract gives every session its own FIFO and runs
   * sessions in parallel (AGENTS.md §"Concurrency contract"), so the
   * turn keeps executing against its own session and saves its
   * transcript there. What must not follow the operator to the new
   * thread:
   *
   * - the abort handle — Esc in the new thread must abort nothing;
   *   parked in `detachedTurns` and restored on switch-back;
   * - parked queue messages — aimed at the old thread; announced drop
   *   with previews, same shape as the abort path, never silent;
   * - a pending approval — the modal closes with the transcript it
   *   asks about, so the request is denied at the gate with an
   *   explicit reason; left unresolved it would park the turn forever
   *   on `await request()`;
   * - session grants — deferred, not dropped: the running turn keeps
   *   the exceptions the operator granted it, and `runOneTurn` clears
   *   them when the backgrounded turn finishes. Yanking them here
   *   would make the background turn re-prompt from off screen.
   *
   * With no turn of OURS in flight, the approval deny and the grant
   * clear still apply — scoped to the thread being left. The deny does
   * not depend on who started the turn: a scheduler/HTTP-origin turn's
   * pending approval is just as unanswerable once its transcript is
