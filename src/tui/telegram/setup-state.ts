/**
 * High-level "where the operator is in the connect flow" enum,
 * derived from the flat `TelegramPanelState` mirrors. Pure projection
 * — no new fields in the reducer — so the setup view and the existing
 * advanced controls stay strictly synchronised on the same source of
 * truth.
 *
 * Locked invariants (pinned by `setup-state.test.ts`):
 *  - `ready` is the **only** step that requires *all three* runtime
 *    facts: token present, channel `up`, owner persisted. Anything
 *    less collapses into the appropriate setup step.
 *  - `pairing_active` strictly tracks `mode === "pairingActive"`; it
 *    is the only step that depends on UI mode. Every other step is
 *    derivable from runtime state alone.
 *  - The function never reads `tokenPrompt.buffer`. The bot token is
 *    not part of the setup taxonomy — only `hasToken` (boolean).
