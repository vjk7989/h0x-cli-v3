/**
 * Frame tearing, and the one escape sequence that ends it.
 *
 * Ink paints by writing a whole frame to stdout: cursor home, then every
 * line, then the trailing clear. On a terminal that renders as bytes
 * arrive, the moment between the first line and the last is a moment
 * where the screen holds half of the previous frame and half of the
 * next. Redraw often enough and that reads as the UI *shaking* — which
 * is the word the Windows 10 report used, and the right one.
 *
 * It is not equally visible everywhere. macOS terminals coalesce
 * aggressively enough to hide most of it; Windows Terminal and conhost
 * do not, which is how a cross-platform behaviour arrived as a Windows
 * bug report.
 *
 * DEC private mode 2026 — "synchronized output" — is the fix the
 * terminal side already implemented. `CSI ? 2026 h` tells the emulator
 * to hold what it renders until `CSI ? 2026 l`, so a frame appears whole
 * or not at all.
 *
 * **Why it is safe to send unconditionally.** An unrecognised DEC private
 * mode is ignored — that is what the "private" in the name buys, and it
 * is why terminals without 2026 have always received these bytes from
 * other TUIs without complaint. There is no probe here for the same
 * reason there is none in `alt-screen.ts`: asking costs a round trip on
 * a stdin something else is reading, and the fallback is exactly the
 * behaviour we have today.
 *
 * `H0X_CLI_NO_SYNC_OUTPUT=1` (or legacy `ATOMIC_AGENT_NO_SYNC_OUTPUT=1`)
 * turns it off for anyone who finds a
 * terminal that mishandles it.

 * Implemented by replacing `stdout.write` rather than by handing Ink a
 * wrapper stream, because Ink reads `columns`, `rows` and the `resize`
 * event off that same object — a proxy would have to forward all of it
 * correctly, and getting that subtly wrong breaks resize handling in a
 * way much harder to spot than tearing. Patching one method on the real
 * stream leaves every other property where it was. `alt-screen.ts` and
 * `mouse-tracking.ts` already own the terminal this way.
 *
 * Non-TTY streams (pipes, CI, the test renderer) are left alone: there
 * is nothing to tear, and the markers would be noise in a captured log.
