 *
 * **Why chords and not letters.** The chat composer stays live while a
 * prompt is up — that is how an operator answers the agent in words
 * instead of a verdict — so a bare `y` is ambiguous by construction.
 * The old rule resolved it with the buffer: with nothing typed the
 * letters decided, and from the first character on every key was text.
 * That works right up until someone starts a message with "yes, but…",
 * at which point the `y` has already approved the call. A modified key
 * is never text, so the ambiguity does not arise and the buffer no
 * longer has to arbitrate.
 *
 * **Why these four letters.** Every one of them is unclaimed both by
 * the app's global chords and by the live editor underneath. That is
 * the whole constraint, and it is tighter than it looks:
 *
 *   - `ctrl+a` / `ctrl+e` / `ctrl+u` / `ctrl+k` / `ctrl+w` are the
 *     editor's own line-editing bindings (`multi-line-editor-keys.ts`).
 *     Claiming one would fix the typing collision in one direction and
 *     open it in the other — an operator mid-message would lose
 *     delete-word to a *deny*.
 *   - `ctrl+c` / `ctrl+p` / `ctrl+g` / `ctrl+l` / `ctrl+n` / `ctrl+o` /
 *     `ctrl+q` / `ctrl+r` / `ctrl+t` / `ctrl+x` are global.
 *   - `ctrl+s` is XOFF, which a terminal outside our raw mode (screen,
 *     an ssh hop with flow control on) can still eat.
 *
 * That leaves `ctrl+y`, `ctrl+d`, `ctrl+f` and `ctrl+b`.
 *
 * **Why `ctrl+b` does two jobs.** `[a]` (grant this command shape) is
 * offered only for a `shell` request, and `[e]` (edit the target path)
 * only where `redirectablePath` is set — which `os.fs.write` is the
 * only tool that does. The two can never be on screen together, so
 * they are one slot in the prompt and one chord on the keyboard. The
 * button says which one it currently is; `approval-key-arbitration`
 * pins the exclusivity so a future tool cannot quietly break it.
